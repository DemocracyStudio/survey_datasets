# survey_datasets
This repository hosts the survey datasets collected in Taipei, Tel Aviv and Tallinn, three cities which are the three case studies of my PhD research on Stakeholder Engagement in Smart-City. It has been collected by sending the link to respondents, both in direct and through common social networks. I am sharing this dataset in order to offer some possibilities of collaboration around my research.
